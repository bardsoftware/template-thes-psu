The Penn State Thesis class file and template for use with LaTeX. This is version 2.4.0 of the psuthesis.cls and version 1.3.0 of the template. The file psuthesis.cls was last modified on 10/21/2013. The template files were last modified 10/21/2013. The 10/21/2013 changes should bring the generated document in line with Graduate School requirements. Please notify the author if you find any problems.

This is a template file to help get you started using the
 psuthesis.cls for theses and dissertations at Penn State
 University. You will, of course, need to put the
 psuthesis.cls file someplace that LaTeX will find it.

We have set up a directory structure that we find to be clean
 and convenient. You can readjust it to suit your tastes. In
 fact, the structure used by our students is even a little
 more involved and commands are defined to point to the
 various directories.

This document has been set up to be typeset using pdflatex.
 About the only thing you will need to change if typesetting
 using latex is the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command.

The psuthesis document class uses the same options as the
 book class. In addition, it requires that you have the
 ifthen, calc, setspace, and tocloft packages.

The first additional option specifies the degree type. You
 can choose from: Ph.D. using class option <phd>
, M.S. using class option <ms>
, M.Eng. using class option <meng>
, M.A. using class option <ma>
, B.S. using class option <bs>
,	B.A. using class option <ba>
, Honors Baccalaureate using the option <honors>

If you specify either ba or bs in addition to honors, it will
 just use the honors option and ignore the ba or bs option.

The second additional option <inlinechaptertoc> determines
 the formatting of the Chapter entries in the Table of
 Contents. The default sets them as two-line entries (try it).
 If you want them as one-line entries, issue the
 inlinechaptertoc option.

The class option ``honors'' should be used for theses
 submitted to the Schreyer Honors College. This option
 changes the formatting on the Title page so that the
 signatures appear on the Title page.

The class option ``honorsdepthead'' adds the signature of the
 department head on the Title page for those baccalaureate
 theses that require this.

The class option ``secondthesissupervisor'' should be used
 for baccalaureate honors degrees if you have a second
 Thesis Supervisor.

The vita is only included with the phd option and it is
 placed at the end of the thesis. The permissions page is only
 included with the ms, meng, and ma options.
